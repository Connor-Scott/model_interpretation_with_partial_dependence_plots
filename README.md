# model_interpretation_with_Partial_Dependence_Plots
Analysis of lending tree data for predicting an interest rate of a loan based on income and credit score. 

This notebook uses both a linear regression to analyze the data and then utilizes the XGBoost Library to isolate features that are the most predictive of the target variable, Loan Interest Rate. Associated with this is a plot of the decision tree, a histogram of the most predictive features, and a force plot. These dependency plots identify the variables. These plots indicate which independent variables are the most predictive or impactful on the dependent variable, loan interest rate.
